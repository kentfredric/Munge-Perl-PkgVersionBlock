SYNOPSIS
            use Path::Class qw( file );
        
            my $document = Munge::Perl::PkgVersionBlock->parse( scalar file('path/to/foo.pm')->slurp );
        
            for my $package ( $document->packages ) {
        
                    next unless $package->is_block;
                
                    if ( $package->has_block_version ) {
                            printf "Package %s has version %s \n" , $package->name,   $package->block_version ;
                    }
                
                    $package->set_block_version( v5.12 );
                
                    printf "Package %s now has version %s \n" , $package->name,   $package->block_version ;

            }

            file('path/to/foo.pm')->splat( $document->serialize );

FIRST PASS
    This is a first pass attempt at present. Basically scans for

            qr{
                    ^
                    \s*
                    package
                    \s+
                    $package_declaration_regex
                    \s+
                    $version_declaration_regex
                    \s+
                    \{
            }msx

    And provides in-place removal/injection/replacement of the version part
    in that declaration.
